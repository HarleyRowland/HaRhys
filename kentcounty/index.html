              Kent County Hog Roast is a family run business based in Borough Green in Kent. We specialise in providing everything you need for a high quality hog roast or BBQ catering in Kent and the surrounding areas whether it is a Wedding, private party or corporate event.
              Our aim is to provide the highest quality experience and ensure that we provide you with everything you'll need to host a great hog roast at your event, from the roasting machine and the cooking gas, to the succulent hog itself. We have trained chefs on hand to prepare, cook and serve up your hog roast to your guests, meaning you won't need to worry about a thing on the day.
              We are flexible in our approach, if you have an enquiry outside of what is listed on the Website, please get in touch and we will do our best to meet your requirements.  Remember that it does not need to be a "Hog" Roast - You may prefer something a little different, Beef, Lamb, Wild Boar, or Venison for example.
